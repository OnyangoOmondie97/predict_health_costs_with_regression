# Healthcare Costs Prediction Project
This project aims to predict healthcare costs using a regression algorithm. The dataset contains information about different people, including their healthcare costs.

# Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/OnyangoOmondie97/predict_health_costs_with_regression.git
cd healthcare-costs-prediction


# Usage
Execute the main script:

python healthcare_costs_prediction.py
This script loads the dataset, preprocesses the data, builds a linear regression model, trains the model, and evaluates its performance.

# Model Evaluation
To test the model's performance, run the following:

python evaluate_model.py
This will display the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on the testing set. The challenge is to achieve an MAE under 3500 for successful prediction of healthcare costs.

# Results
Check the predictions and true values by plotting:

python plot_predictions.py
